# Powerpuff-Girls ISS project

# Project theme: Conference Management System

## Desired tech stack
  - We will start with the PERN stack (PostgrSQL, Express, React, Node.js), used with rest APIs
  - For test we will use Jest.
  - Goal at the end of the semester: create a mobile app in Flutter to be used with the Node Back-end
  - Goal 2 at the end of the semester: migrate the project to Next.js instead of React and use graphQL APIs
  - Goal 3: try to implement CI/CD
